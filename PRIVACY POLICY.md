PRIVACY POLICY — SortIt
Last Updated: November 26, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how SortIt (“the Extension”) collects, uses, stores, and protects information when users install or interact with the SortIt browser extension. SortIt is developed to help users organize and manage downloaded files efficiently.

By using the Extension, you agree to the practices described in this policy.

1. Information We Collect

1.1. Information Collected by the Extension (Local Only)
The following data may be stored locally on the user’s device:
• Extension settings (such as auto-sorting enable/disable)
• Download categorization data (file counts, sizes, and categories)
• Recent download activity metadata (filename, file type, timestamp)
• Custom sorting rules created by the user

This data is stored entirely on the user’s local device and is never transmitted to external servers unless the user chooses to enable cloud features.

1.2. Information Collected When Cloud or Account Features Are Enabled (Future Features)
If the user creates an account or enables cloud-synced features, SortIt may collect:
• Email address (for user authentication)
• Authentication information (hashed credentials or OAuth tokens)
• User-defined sorting rules or preferences (to sync across devices)
• Subscription status (for premium features)

This information is used solely to provide account-based services and is not sold or shared with third parties for advertising or unrelated purposes.

1.3. Information Automatically Collected by Browsers or Servers
If users interact with a SortIt web dashboard or cloud service, standard server logs may record:
• IP address
• Browser type
• General device information
• Request timestamps

This information is used for security, fraud prevention, and service maintenance.

2. What SortIt Does NOT Collect

SortIt does NOT collect or access:
• Browsing history
• Web page content
• Personal communications
• Files or data outside the Downloads directory
• Sensitive categories (health, financial, government IDs, etc.)
• Precise location data
• Keystrokes, clicks, or behavioral tracking
• Advertising identifiers

SortIt only interacts with downloads provided through the browser’s downloads API.

3. How Information Is Used

Information collected by SortIt is used strictly for:
• Organizing downloaded files into categories
• Applying user preferences and settings
• Improving extension functionality
• Providing cloud synchronization and account-based services (if enabled)
• Activating premium features (if subscribed)

SortIt does not use information for advertising, profiling, or data monetization.

4. Data Storage and Security

4.1. Local Storage
Most features operate fully on-device. Local data never leaves the user’s browser or computer unless cloud features are activated.

4.2. Cloud-Synced Data (Optional Future Feature)
If cloud features are used:
• Data is encrypted in transit
• Credentials are securely hashed
• Only minimal necessary data is stored

4.3. No Remote Code Execution
SortIt does not load or execute any remote JavaScript or code. All executable logic is packaged within the extension.

5. Sharing of Information

SortIt does not:
• Sell user data
• Share user data with advertisers
• Transfer data to third parties unrelated to core functionality

Information may be shared only in the following limited situations:
• With secure payment processors (subscription verification only)
• To comply with legal obligations
• To maintain or protect SortIt services (e.g., fraud prevention)

6. User Rights

Depending on jurisdiction, users may have the right to:
• Access stored information
• Request deletion of cloud-stored data
• Update account information
• Disable or remove the extension at any time
• Withdraw consent for cloud features

Users may delete all local data at any time by uninstalling the extension.

7. Children’s Privacy

SortIt is not intended for use by children under 13 and does not knowingly collect information from children.

8. Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically. The “Last Updated” date will reflect the most recent revision. Continued use of the Extension after updates constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
